1. Introduction
This documentation outlines the design, setup, and usage of the AI-Assisted Open Data Dashboardâ€”a scalable web application that fetches, processes, and visualizes government open data using AI-assisted coding tools. It serves as a guide for developers, designers, and project stakeholders.

2. Project Overview
Purpose: Provide a dynamic and interactive dashboard for exploring structured open data from government APIs.
Vision: Combine AI-assisted coding with robust data processing to create an intuitive user interface that caters both to data experts and casual users.
Key Objectives:
Streamlined data ingestion and processing.
Interactive, responsive dashboards.
Scalability and modular design for future expansion.
3. System Architecture
Frontend: A React-based UI that offers search, filtering, and visualization.
Backend: A FastAPI (or Flask) service responsible for data ingestion, processing, and serving data through RESTful endpoints.
Database: A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite) for persistent storage. Optionally, Redis for caching frequently accessed queries.
AI-Assisted Tools: Cursor AI to generate boilerplate code and assist in rapid prototyping.
4. Technology Stack
Backend
Language: Python
Framework: FastAPI (or Flask as an alternative for simplicity)
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
requests for API calls
uvicorn for asynchronous server management
Key Components:
Data ingestion module
Data processing and validation routines
RESTful API endpoints for data access
Frontend
Language: JavaScript (ES6+)
Framework: React
Libraries:
UI Components: Tailwind CSS or Material UI
Data Display: React Table for structured data views
Visualizations: Chart.js or Recharts
Data Fetching: Axios or Fetch API for REST calls
Database & Caching
Database Options: SQLite for initial development or PostgreSQL for production
Caching: Consider Redis for query optimization and performance enhancement
5. Core Features
Data Processing & API
Fetching structured data (CSV/JSON) from government APIs
Data validation, preprocessing, and error handling
RESTful endpoints for accessing processed data
Interactive Dashboard UI
Searchable and sortable data tables
Advanced filters and keyword search
Dynamic charts and graphs for data visualization
Responsive design for mobile and desktop experiences
AI-Assisted Coding
Integration with Cursor AI for generating code templates and accelerating development
6. Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Backend: Python 3.8+, pip
Frontend: Node.js 14+, npm or yarn
Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite (depending on environment)
Others: Docker (optional for containerization)
Backend Setup
Clone the repository.
Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables (e.g., API keys, database URL).
Run the FastAPI server:
bash
Copy
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory.
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
npm install
Start the development server:
bash
Copy
npm start
7. Usage Instructions
Data Ingestion and Processing
Fetch Data: Use the backend module to call government API endpoints.
Process Data: Leverage pandas to clean, validate, and structure the data.
Store Data: Save processed data to the database for efficient querying.
API Endpoints
GET /data: Retrieve a list of processed data records.
GET /data/{id}: Fetch details for a specific data point.
POST /data/import: Endpoint for triggering manual data ingestion (secured for admin use).
Detailed API documentation is available via the integrated Swagger UI provided by FastAPI.
Dashboard Interaction
Homepage Options:
Template Dashboard: Users can import and manipulate data similarly to Power BI.
Categorical Index: Browse data by category and click through to view dedicated dashboards.
User Experience: The UI supports advanced filtering, sorting, and real-time updates as new data is ingested.
8. Development Workflow
Project Phases
Planning & Research: Define data sources, API structure, and UX design.
MVP Development: Generate boilerplate code with Cursor AI, implement basic API calls, and build a functional dashboard.
Optimization & Deployment: Enhance backend performance, improve UI/UX, and deploy on a cloud platform.
Contribution Guidelines
Code Style: Follow PEP 8 for Python and established JavaScript style guides.
Branching Strategy: Use feature branches for development. Merge through pull requests after code reviews.
Documentation: Update the documentation alongside new features or changes.
9. Testing and Quality Assurance
Unit Testing: Use frameworks such as PyTest (backend) and Jest (frontend).
Integration Testing: Ensure that API endpoints correctly serve data to the frontend.
Continuous Integration: Integrate automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline.
Performance Testing: Monitor data ingestion and UI responsiveness under load.
10. Deployment
Local Environment
Use Docker for local containerization to simulate production.
Ensure environment variables and dependencies are correctly set up.
Cloud Deployment
Backend: Deploy FastAPI on AWS Lambda, DigitalOcean, or a VPS.
Frontend: Host on Vercel, Netlify, or any static file server.
CI/CD: Implement pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
11. Future Enhancements
User Authentication: Personalize dashboards and secure data ingestion endpoints.
Data Caching: Integrate Redis to optimize query performance.
Multi-Source Integration: Expand to include additional government and public data sources.
AI Chatbot: Develop an AI assistant to guide users through the data exploration process.
